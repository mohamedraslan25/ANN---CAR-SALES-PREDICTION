# 🚗 ANN - Car Sales Prediction

This project implements an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** to predict car sales prices based on various customer and financial attributes. The model is trained using **Deep Neural Networks (DNN)** with the **Adam optimizer** and **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** as the loss function.

## 📌 Features

### ✅ Data Preprocessing

- Applied **MinMaxScaler** to normalize data for better training performance.
- Performed data **manipulation** using Pandas and NumPy.
- Visualized relationships using **pairplots** for feature analysis.

### ✅ Model Architecture & Training

- Implemented a **Deep Neural Network (DNN)** for regression.
- Used the **Adam optimizer** for efficient gradient updates.
- Evaluated performance using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.

### ✅ Model Evaluation

- Assessed prediction accuracy with **loss analysis** and evaluation metrics.
- Compared predicted values with actual sales data.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python** (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **Scikit-learn** (MinMaxScaler, MSE evaluation)
